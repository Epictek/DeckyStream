## Thanks

Thanks to @AAGaming for Deckorder of which this plugin uses UI code from https://git.catvibers.me/aa/Deckorder 

@avery for Recapture which I used as a reference for gstreamer https://git.sr.ht/~avery/recapture
and the rest of the Decky team for being helpful in Discord and providing the awesome plugin loader.
